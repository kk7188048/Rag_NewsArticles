Starring Paul Rudd and Jack Black, the film will arrive in theaters on Christmas Day. (Spoilers for the 1997 film below.) The original Anaconda was your basic B-movie creature feature, only with an all-star cast and better production values. The plot revolved around a documentary film crew (Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, and Owen Wilson) who travel to the Amazon in search of a long-lost Indigenous tribe. They take on a stranded Paraguayan snake hunter named Serone (Jon Voight, affecting a hilariously bad foreign accent), who strong-arms them into helping him hunt down a 25-foot green anaconda. He wants to capture the animal alive, thinking he can sell it for over $1 million.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "When Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began wielding its ax at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year, many believed this was done to weaken the agency's oversight over Tesla. But despite the Tesla CEO's sometimes-close relationship with the Trump administration, it appears there is still some independence left within NHTSA: earlier this week, the agency opened a new safety investigation into the door handles of the Tesla Model Y. The timing may not be coincidental; last week, the safety hazard posed by badly designed retractable door handles entered the spotlight thanks to a comprehensive report by Bloomberg's Dana Hull. As Hull detailed, Tesla's door handles rely on the car's 12 V battery to work. Should this fail, there is no way to open the doors from the outside, something that has cost lives as first responders have been unable to free occupants from burning Teslas. While front seat passengers have easily accessible interior emergency door releases, some Teslas lack any way of opening the rear doors from the inside after a crash. Other, more recent Models 3 and Y have manual releases located under a panel underneath the rear seat.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "Google is partnering with a UK nonprofit to fight non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). (You may know it better as revenge porn.) Over the coming months, the company will begin using StopNCII's hashes. These user-uploaded digital fingerprints can block individuals' unwanted intimate content from appearing in search results. StopNCII has a pretty neat system to combat revenge porn. Say you have some images you most definitely don't want surfacing online. Select the picture on your device, and StopNCII will create a digital fingerprint of the file. That hash will be uploaded to the service. The photo itself never leaves your device. The organization then shares the hash (again, not the spicy pic) with participating platforms. Then, if an asshole ex takes the liberty of uploading said photo to one of those companies' services, it should be removed automatically. If the platform uses real-time hash matching, it can even block the upload immediately before it reaches anyone's eyes. It's a pretty solid defense against an ugly problem. The system isn't bulletproof. First, it only works for known images. So, if someone else has an intimate photo that you don't have a copy of, you'll have to fight that using other means. StopNCII doesn't work for AI-generated images, audio recordings or saucy text chats. The system also won't help if the content is uploaded to a non-partner platform. In addition to Google, StopNCII partners with Meta, Reddit, Pornhub, OnlyFans, Snap, Microsoft Bing, X and more. This is far from Google's first move to combat NCII. A decade ago, it created a system for submitting revenge porn takedown requests. In 2024, it made it easier to remove deepfake NCII. On Wednesday, Google product manager Griffin Hunt explained that \"given the scale of the open web, there's more to be done to reduce the burden on those who are affected by it.\" If you're 18 or older and have any photos of yourself that you want to flag proactively, you can start using StopNCII right now. Head to the org's website to create a case. Note that the service only works for pictures that are nude, semi-nude or show a sexual act. And remember, the photo itself never leaves your device, so your privacy remains intact.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-upgrade-its-revenge-porn-defenses-with-help-from-a-uk-nonprofit-181016291.html?src=rss",

It will be available on October 21 and will cost $160. Logitech's other new gaming mouse is the G Pro X Superstrike, which boasts a haptics system in its main click buttons, allowing players to customize their actuation points. It also has battery life of up to 90 hours and weighs 65 grams. There's no pricing information yet, and the release window is broadly set for the first quarter of 2026. Logitech The company also announced a pair of headsets. The Astro A20 X is a mid-range model with the handy feature of being able to connect to two consoles or PCs at once. It has 40 mm PRO-G Audio Drivers, and RGB settings. Battery life is up to 40 hours with the RGB equipped or up to 90 hours without. The A20 X comes with the same microphone as Logitech's Astro A50 X model, which is one of our favorite gaming headsets. The A20 X will cost $180 and will be available on October 8. The other new headset is the G321 Lightspeed, a budget option at $60. This set has just 20 hours of battery life and emphasizes wearability in the design. It will be available starting sometime in October. The rest of the G Play lineup includes the G515 Rapid TKL keyboard, which has a low profile and magnetic analog switches. That's available today for $170. Logitech also added new RS50 and RS pedals for driving games. On the software side, the company has also added a game launcher to its G Hub portal.

      "description": "It's somewhat ironic that Apple, the company that popularized the use of capacitive touchscreens with the iPhone and iPad, has been staunchly opposed to bringing our fingers anywhere near MacBook screens. Meanwhile, Microsoft and PC makers jumped at the opportunity to build touchscreen laptops years ago. The tablet-focused Windows 8 was a failure, sure, but touchscreens led to excellent convertible notebooks and hybrid tablets like the Surface lineup. Now, according to a new rumor from longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple might finally be ready to bring touchscreens to the MacBook Pro.In a tweet posted this morning, Kuo wrote, \"MacBook models will feature a touch panel for the first time, further blurring the line with the iPad. This shift appears to reflect Apples long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the overall user experience.\"MacBook models will feature a touch panel for the first time, further blurring the line with the iPad. This shift appears to reflect Apples long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the  (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) September 17, 2025 Specifically, Kuo says that touchscreen MacBook Pro models are \"expected to enter mass production by late 2026,\" and that they'll use on-cell touch technology. Cheaper MacBooks (likely the Air) coming in late 2025 likely won't have touchscreens, but that could change with a 2027 refresh.Its worth pointing out that Kuos predictions, which typically come from sources within Apples supply chain, arent always accurate. But given the timing of this particular note, and the ubiquity of touchscreen laptops these days, its the idea of a touchscreen MacBook isnt too farfetched.Apple is a stubborn company, no doubt  especially when it comes to adopting features from others. When referring to iPad competitors in 2010, Steve Jobs famously said, \"If you see a stylus, they blew it.\" While he was referring to using a stylus for general operation of a device, and not a highly specific use-case, it was still funny to see the Apple Pencil arrive five years later on the iPad Pro. There's a certain nobility to sticking with your design convictions, but it would have been stupid for Apple to completely ignore the benefits of tablet stylii, something Microsoft was leaning into hard with its Surface devices. So it goes with the touchscreen MacBook Pros. It's hard to deny the convenience of lazily swiping the screen when scrolling through long articles, instead of tapping repeatedly on your keyboard or swiping a touchpad. Apple's desire to keep touchscreens away from Macs is understandable. MacOS doesn't have large touch-points like iPadOS, and it's been honed for decades to work best with keyboards, mice and touchpads. But adding in basic touchscreen support doesn't really require a complete macOS redesign, especially when the platform has already had support for multitouch gestures on trackpads since the first MacBook Air arrived in 2008.It's funny that the touchscreen MacBook Pro could also be arriving just as Apple is finally starting to make the iPad more Mac-like. iPadOS 26 adds the ability to resize app windows, easily organize them on your screen and it even brings over the menu bar from MacOS. It's as if Apple is trying to appease all of its fans: The iPad owners who want more multitasking and productivity options, as well as the Mac owners who want a bit of iPad-like convenience.Both of my kids were able to nimbly swipe around my phones and tablets at the age of two  that's the power of a truly intuitive input mechanism. And to a certain degree, I also think it helped them get used to the idea of computing in general. If it's easy enough for kids to grasp, why not make touchscreens a core feature of as many products as possible? Simply put, Apple has run out of excuses.
